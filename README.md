# Working with VSCode Codespaces

This template works with the VSCode Codespaces online IDE! Just [fork it](https://github.com/second-state/learn-rust-with-github-actions/fork), 
open it in the online IDE, write Rust code, build, and run it directly from the IDE. No software download or install needed!

> About the cost: the web verison of VSCode costs around $1 per work day. It is cheaper than a cup of coffee in the office.

First, open the [VSCode Codespaces](https://online.visualstudio.com/) web site and login with your Azure account. You can get a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

Next, create a new Codespace from your forked repository.

Then open the `main.rs` and `Cargo.toml` files and code your fancy Rust application!

Click on the Run button in the IDE, and see your Rust application's output in the Terminal window in the IDE.

From the Terminal window, you can see the built results in the `target` directory.

You can log into Github from the IDE, and send code changes or built artifacts back into the GitHub repository.
