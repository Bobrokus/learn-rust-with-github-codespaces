# Working with VSCode Codespaces

This template works with the VSCode Codespaces online IDE! Just [fork it](https://github.com/second-state/learn-rust-with-github-actions/fork), 
open it in the online IDE, write Rust code, build, and run it directly from the IDE. No software download or install needed!

> About the cost: the web verison of VSCode costs around $1 per work day. It is cheaper than a cup of coffee in the office.

First, open the [VSCode Codespaces](https://online.visualstudio.com/) web site and login with your Azure account. You can get a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

Next, create a new Codespace from your forked repository.

Then open the `main.rs` and `Cargo.toml` files and code your fancy Rust application!

![Code in Codespace](https://www.secondstate.io/external/img/vscode_code.png)

Click on the Run Debug button in the left panel, and then the Run button at the top. 

![Run the Rust program](https://www.secondstate.io/external/img/vscode_run_button.png)

See your Rust application run. Its standard output is displayed in the Terminal window in the IDE.

![See output in terminal](https://www.secondstate.io/external/img/vscode_run.png)

From the Terminal window, you can run any Linux command including `cargo` and `rustup`. For example, you can manually run the executable binary in the `target` directory.

Now, go learn Rust or try out the examples in your new IDE!
